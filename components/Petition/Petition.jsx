                  <p>(Hereafter collectively “Elected Officials” or “You”),</p>
                  <p>
                    Dear Elected Officials, The Kingdom of Kush (“Kingdom”) is
                    proclaiming sovereignty in the territory of Bir Tawil in
                    accordance with the applicable international law. Bir Tawil
                    (a territory located between Egypt and Sudan) has not been
                    claimed by any state and therefore is what is referred to as
                    Terra Nullius "no man's land."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Kingdom will attract and welcome people of all races and
                    religions. It will serve as an education and cutting edge
                    technology empowerment cradle for generations to come. The
                    Kingdom will help bring economic prosperity and social
                    stability to the entire continent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, with the Kingdom of Kush functioning as a
                    sovereign state, the African Diaspora will have the “right
                    of return” to a place it can call home. These efforts are in
                    accordance with the U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194
                    (III) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (10 December
                    1948). Article 13(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human
                    Rights states: "Everyone has the right to leave any country,
                    including his own, and to return to his country." African
                    Diaspora as the "sixth region" of Africa exists in the
                    constitution of the African Union (“AU”).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, for the benefit of 41.6 million African Americans
                    in the United States, 1.6 billion people of African descent
                    around the world, and the entire human race, we, the
                    undersigned, hereby petition You, the Elected Officials, to
                    recognize the Kingdom of Kush as a sovereign state,
                    establish full diplomatic relations with the Kingdom, and
                    support the Kingdom and its efforts politically and
                    socially.
                  </p>
